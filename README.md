# ApusRubus

Have an idea for a Raspberry Pi project, but Swift is your jam? Switches, PWM, ADC, LCDs, an API server, maybe some serial and an easy to use UI. With Apus Rubus(see what I did there) you can make yoru project a reality....

Once this project is up and running it will consist of some sort of macOS config app, and either pre built rPi binaries or a custom build script.

This package is heavily based on and would not be possible without:

• [SwiftyGPIO](https://github.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO).
• [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor).

Currently Supports:
* GPIO

Future Support:
* PWM Output(PCA9685)
* Analog to Digital(MC3008)
